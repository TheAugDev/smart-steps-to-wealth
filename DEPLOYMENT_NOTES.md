# Smart Steps to Wealth - Vercel Deployment Notes

## Changes Made

The application has been updated to use Vercel serverless functions instead of making direct API calls to the Gemini API from the frontend. This provides several security and architectural benefits:

### Security Improvements
- ✅ API key is now stored securely on the server-side (Vercel environment variables)
- ✅ No more exposure of API keys in frontend code
- ✅ Requests to Gemini API are made from server-side, hiding implementation details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/App.js`** - Updated 3 functions to use Vercel API:
   - `generateSpendingInsights()`
   - `generatePlan()`
   - `generateDebtCoachPlan()`

2. **`api/generateAIPlan.js`** - Fixed environment variable name from `REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY` to `GEMINI_API_KEY`

### Architecture Changes

**Before:** Frontend → Direct API call → Gemini API
**After:** Frontend → Vercel API `/api/generateAIPlan` → Gemini API

## Deployment Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables in Vercel
You need to set the following environment variable in your Vercel project dashboard:

- **Variable Name:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **Value:** Your actual Gemini API key
- **Scope:** Production, Preview, and Development

### 2. Vercel Project Setup
The project is already configured with:
- ✅ `vercel.json` file for proper routing
- ✅ API function in `/api/generateAIPlan.js`
- ✅ Proper serverless function structure

### 3. Testing the Deployment

After deploying to Vercel:

1. **Test the AI Features:**
   - "Get AI Insights" button in the Cashflow Analysis section
   - "Generate Plan" buttons in Financial Goals
   - "Get My AI Financial Plan" button in the Debt Coach section

2. **Check Browser Network Tab:**
   - API calls should now go to `/api/generateAIPlan` instead of `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`
   - No API keys should be visible in the request headers

### 4. Error Handling
The functions include proper error handling:
- Server errors return meaningful messages
- API key configuration issues are caught
- Network failures are handled gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable in Vercel dashboard
3. Test all AI features
4. Monitor Vercel function logs for any issues

## Notes

- The Vercel function accepts a `prompt` parameter in the request body
- All three AI features use the same endpoint but with different prompts
- The response format remains the same, so no frontend parsing changes were needed
- The original API response structure is preserved
